## Installation

In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on **anaconda distribution 4.5.11** in combination with **python 3.6.6**. The scripts require additional python libraries.

Run the following commands in anaconda prompt to be able to run the scripts that are provided in this git repository.
- `conda install scikit-learn`
- `conda install pandas`
- `conda install numpy`
- `conda install seaborn`
- `conda install matplotlib`

Two quick start options are available:

## Project motivation
For the first term of the nanodegree [become a data scientist](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) of [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) I got involved in this project. In this project I used clustering algorithms to analyse the German population and analyse over and underrepresented population groups at webshop Arvato.

## File descriptions

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files. Note that the data cannot be published in this repository.

```text
Arvato/
├── Data_Dictionary.md
├── Identify_Customer_Segments.html
├── Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb
└── README.md
```

## Results
The clustering shows that the mail-order company is popular among people who have above average interest in finance, have a lot of money saved and belong to the top-earners in Germany.
